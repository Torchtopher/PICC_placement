assume port is not viable

problem:
want to know when it is best to replace picc line to keep infection risk lowest while also accouting for other factors

to minimize factors:
  cost * did get infection         day * risk of infection (X infections per 1000 catheter days) cumaltive??
  cost * days with picc
  cost * times picc inserted
  cost * went to ER without access

impl:

    generate all fesible solution 
    sim 10000 times through next 100 days
    record score
    next 

generate all fesible solution: -> how many is this?
   huerstics:
      - max 5 picc lines
      - must take out line directly after chemo OR directly after when ER visit would occur (7 days after chemo) 
      - must place line directly before chemo     

    1 solution: list of days when picc is taken out and put back in
    1 chemo session: 

4 chemo left + up to 4 ER 

next aviable take out is after chemo 1
